       but my favority hobbie is spend time with my family. They are really fun.</p>       
    <p>I served in Brazil Salvador South Mission from 2021-2022. It is only been 3 months since I returned from my mission. 
       It is been hard to put everything togather, but I found on BYUI a start. My plan is start Applied Technology degree
